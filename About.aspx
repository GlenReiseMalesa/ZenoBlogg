            Under the fair use clause of the Berne convention , which is reproduced in the copyright laws of all signatory countries, including the United States, Canada and Japan1, information can be reproduced for the dissemination of News with the following guidelines:

The material must be properly attributed to the original source. The Berne convention was created before people started to use the Internet to disseminate news and makes no mention of links, however recent court cases and new laws passed in some countries makes linking to the source a requirement.
The material must be re-written in the words of those that wish to re-disseminate it. Cutting and Pasting an entire article is illegal. However quoting an excerpt of an article is permitted.
(Not in the Berne convention) Furthermore, it is suggested that any given publication or website cannot use the fair use clause to rely entirely on another publication for all of its news. If you are going to repost news items from Anime News Network or any other source, no given source should be responsible for the majority of your news and you should have at least some original news content of your own.
In short: 1) Link to the source, 2) use your own words 3) Don't rely on one single source and 4) Have some original content.

Provided the above 4 guidelines are met, you do not need to ask our permission to repost items from our website if your purpose is to provide news to your audience. Despite not needing to ask our permission, we do appreciate a friendly note to inform us that you are using our news. Under no circumstances will Anime News Network pressure a website or publication to remove our content if the above circumstances are met.
